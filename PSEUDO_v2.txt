Inventory Management — Pseudocode v0.2.0

What's new in v0.2.0
- Centralized DB access via `db_cursor()` context manager.
- Password hashing (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256) + migration of legacy plaintext passwords.
- Logging to `app.log` and safer image path resolution.
- Switched ad-hoc DB calls in UI modules to use `db_cursor()` and parameterized queries.
- Added `VERSION` and sample license files.

Key flows (concise)
- Login:
  - Read stored password for username.
  - If stored value contains salt (`salt$hash`), `verify_password()`.
  - If stored plaintext matches, re-hash with `hash_password()` and update DB.

- Add/Update records:
  - UI validates inputs.
  - Use `with db_cursor() as (cursor, conn):` to run CREATE/SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE with parameterized queries.
  - Commit inside context and call `treeview_data()` to refresh UI.

Migration notes
- If you have many users with plaintext passwords, run a migration script or let users log in once to migrate their password to hashed form automatically.
- Verify database table names and column names (some typos existed historically).

Suggested bump policy
- Bump `VERSION` to `0.2.0` for these changes; use `0.3.0` for UI refactors; `1.0.0` for stable/public release.
